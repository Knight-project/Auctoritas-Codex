Welcome to **Auctoritas Codex**. I built this app as a lightweight web-wrapper for the Google Site of the same name. It’s a solo hobby project I designed to make our academic resources easier to access without dealing with browser tabs.

This was made specifically for my batchmates in the **OSL 9th Batch, FBS, University of Dhaka**, but anyone else from the OSL department is free to use it and highly encouraged to do so if it helps.

## What is it? 
The app is a focused gateway to the Codex site. I kept the UI minimal and the aesthetic clean to make sure the website itself stays the main focus. No clutter, just the materials you need.

### Key Features:
* **Full Integration:** A dedicated window for the Auctoritas Codex site.
* **Upload & Download Support:** I’ve made sure file handling works—you can download notes or upload resources directly through the app.
* **Minimalist Design:** No extra fluff. The UI is simple and stays out of the way.
* **First Release:** Version 1.0 is officially out and ready for use.

## Current Status
* **Internet Required:** For now, the app only works if you are connected to the internet. 
* **Offline Features:** I am working on adding offline support soon so you can check your files even without a connection.

## Roadmap 
Since this is a personal project, I'll be updating it as I go. Upcoming goals include:
* **Offline Mode:** Local caching for documents.
* **Optimization:** Making the wrapper even lighter and faster.
